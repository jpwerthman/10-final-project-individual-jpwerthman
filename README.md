This was my final project for CSE 204 (web developement).
Program Description:
This is a website that I called quickgig.
It uses SeatGeak's API to retrieve data about different events such as, bands, orchestras, and football games.
the website is made up of 3 main parts:
1. The search bar. This is a fully functioning search bar where you input what you are looking for by artist, date, or city into the search bar,
and hit the corresponding button to search for it. This causes the javascript to pull whatever may be relevant from the API.
2. The featured events. This is a bar that pulls a couple of events that are happening soon and features them on the page, so if a customer wasn't sure 
what they were looking for it would give them a couple suggestions to start.
3. The festival lineups. This is an Idea of what the empty space could look like. It features major music festivals' lineups from across the US. 
Ideally all the empty space on the page would be filled up with posters such as these either of festivals or individual artists.
The majority of the work in this program came from using the API, the rest was pretty straight forward javascript, html, css,and bootstrap.
